# 134-Final-Project

In this project, I built a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering and natural language processing. I applied a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model based on user ratings and used TF-IDF vectorization to analyze movie genres and tags. I also developed an interactive web interface with Streamlit, allowing users to input their preferences and receive personalized movie suggestions.
